### Project Overview
1. The aim of this project is to analyze bank customer data to identify the factors contributing to customer churn using Power BI, SQL, and Excel.
2. To gather valuable insights from the analysis to understand patterns, trends, and correlations associated with bank customer data.
3. To provide recommendations to the bank to mitigate churn. It allows banks to address customer needs, improve retention strategies, and save costs associated with acquiring new customers. Identifying at-risk customers allows banks to implement personalized retention strategies, improving customer experience, and reducing attrition rates.

### Problem Statement
The bank is facing a significant challenge with high churn rates and aims to reduce costs linked to customer acquisition. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn is pivotal for tailoring services and implementing targeted retention efforts. This allows the bank to address customer needs, refine retention strategies, and identify at-risk customers for personalized retention strategies.

1. Total customers associated with the bank are 10,000.
2. Churn Rate is 20.37%. Which is higher than the healthy range, churn rate of 5-7% annually is considered average in the banking industry. So the bank should consider this as a serious problem and take necessary actions.
3. Retention Rate 79.63%. High retention rate indicates customer satisfaction and loyalty. Anything above 90% might be considered healthy.
4. Active Customer Rate 51.51%. Desired range for active customer rate is above 70-80%. These desired ranges can vary based on the bank's services and customer engagement strategies. Inactive Customers have a higher churn rate.
6. Credit Card Holder Rate is 70.55%. Bank is doing good in this case. Typically, a rate higher than 50-60% might be considered good, but this can vary widely. But, churn rate is high in case of the credit card holders. People with fair and poor credit score are leaving the bank. 
7. Customers have a varying number of products, typically ranging from 1 to 4. Products Per Customers is 1.53. Around 3-4 products per customer are often seen as a good benchmark. Most of customers has 1 or 2 products and churn rate is more in that range.
